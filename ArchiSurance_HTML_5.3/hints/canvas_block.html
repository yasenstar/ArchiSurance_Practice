   	    <p>A Block Object is a container area that can contain text and an icon. You can also provide your own Help Hints. You can lock the Block if you want to make it read-only.    </p>
   	    <p>A typical scenario is to create a number of container Blocks on the Canvas, arrange them into the desired framework, lock them, and then save the Canvas as a template.</p>
