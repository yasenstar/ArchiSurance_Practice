   	    <p>A Canvas to hold Blocks, Images, Stickies and Connections. You can also provide your own Help Hints.</p>
   	    <p>A typical scenario is to create a number of container Blocks and Stickies on the Canvas, arrange them into the desired framework, lock them, and then save the Canvas as a template.</p>
   	    <p>You can drag and drop image files from the desktop to create Images on the Canvas.</p>
